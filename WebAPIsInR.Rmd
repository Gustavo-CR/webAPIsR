## Overview

- Intro and basic assumptions
- Tools for accessing APIs
- Lots of examples
- Practical application
- Recap
- What next?

## Assumptions

- A general interest in data, its acquisition, and its visualization

- Familiarity with R

- A basic understanding of HTTP communication concepts, if not the syntax

## Assumptions {.smaller}

## What is an API | ... and why would I want to use one?

- API: Application Programming Interface

- APIs allow you to access a program from within another program

- For data retrieval, we usually mean APIs based on HTTP communication, a.k.a. web APIs

- APIs usually provide read and/or write access to data stores

- APIs allow you to access data on an ongoing basis

## Tools for accessing web APIs from R

- packages that wrap API calls for a given service
    - aws.s3, RGoogleAnalytics, acs, etc.

- **httr** for making requests

- **jsonlite, xml2** for parsing the response


*And once you have the data...*

- **dplyr, tidyr, lubridate**, etc. for data wrangling

## Lots of examples

**Example scripts are available at** https://github.com/ajmcoqui/webAPIsR

.

OMDB - http://www.omdbapi.com/

SWAPI - https://swapi.co/

Twitter (OAuth1) - https://api.twitter.com

GitHub (OAuth2) - https://api.github.com

## Practical application {.smaller}

*Support Ticket Reports, in Two Parts*

1. R script to get support ticket data via API
    - Pages through data and puts it all in a single dataframe
    - Filters, tidies, and flattens the raw data into a nice, easy-to-use rectangle
    - Saves the tidied data to an S3 bucket
    - Deployed to RStudio Connect; scheduled to poll the API and update the datastore automatically
2. Various applications and Rmd documents pull the data from S3
    - Visualizations for tickets by product, OS, priority, category/feature, etc.
    - We use this data to target product improvements, documentation enhancements, process improvements

[Support Ticket Demo](SupportTickets.html)

## Other considerations {.smaller}

- API documentation, honesty, response format

- Paging

- Rate limiting/throttling

- Time to first byte (response time)

- Data storage

- Additional **httr** functionality
    - Authentication
        - authenticate(), oauth1.0_token(), oauth2.0_token(), use_proxy()

    - Request modifiers
        - set_cookies(), add_headers(), content_type(), accept()

    - Other
        - stop_for_status(), warn_for_status(), timeout(), verbose(), parse_url(), progress(), etc.

## Recap

- APIs are very useful sources of data, especially for datasets that are updated regularly.

- It's easy to pull API data into R -- and keep it up-to-date -- with the right packages and tools.

- Once you have the data in R, you can do all sorts of wonderful things with it.

> - Our next new support hire should probably be on the West Coast.
